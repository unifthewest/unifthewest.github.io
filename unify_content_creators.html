            <h1>Our Mission</h1>
            <p>We at Unify The West are dedicated to progressing the agenda of Western independence and creating a prosperous, free and safe society for the people of the West. </br>
                Our primary goal is to unify the various movements seeking Western independence in order to collaborate and craft a better deal for the Western provinces.</br>
                This is a volunteer movement ran by and for the people of the West that welcomes multiple approaches provided they all aim to achieve the same thing--significant and meaningful reform for Western Canada.</p>
            <h2>Our Methods</h2>
            <p>-Contacting Municipal Districts in Alberta to force the hand of the provincial government</br>
                -Pushing a petition for a plebiscite in Saskatchewan on the questions of separation and confederation</br>
                -Working with various independence parties in Alberta (Primarily, Alberta Advantage Party, as well as FCP and AIP)</br>
                -Encouraging the people of the West to use and support Western businesses</br>
                -Repairing relationships with First Nations and including First Nations as primary stakeholders in the movement</br>
                -Organizing local events, charitable causes, and peaceful protests to promote the movement</br>
                -Holding regular townhalls, both on the Discord server and in local communities</br>
                -We encourage participating in constitutional conventions and are committed to having a constitution drafted that works for the people of the independent west</br>
