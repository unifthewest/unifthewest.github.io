            <h1>Our Mission</h1>
            <p>We at Unify The West are dedicated to progressing the agenda of Western independence and creating a prosperous, free and safe society for the people of the West. Our primary goal is to unify the various movements seeking Western independence in order to collaborate and craft a better deal for the Western provinces. This is a volunteer movement ran by and for the people of the West that welcomes multiple approaches provided they all aim to achieve the same thing--significant and meaningful reform for Western Canada.</p>

                -Working with various independence parties in Alberta (Primarily, Alberta Advantage Party, as well as FCP and AIP)</br>
